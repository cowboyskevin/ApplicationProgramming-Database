Incremental Model:

1) Develop user base class (Proposed timeline: 1 week)
2) Develop database with one of each user (Proposed timeline: 1 weeks)
3) Create and test student subclass (Proposed timeline: 3 weeks)
    search courses
    add/drop courses
    print their schedule
  (Test) Test to see if the subclass functions operate and if it can use the base class functions
4) Create and test instructor subclass (Proposed timeline: 3 weeks)
    print their schedule
    print their class list
    and search for courses
    (Test) Test to see if the subclass functions operate and if it can use the base class functions
5) Create and test admin subclass (Proposed timeline: 3 weeks)
    add courses to the system
    remove courses from the system
    add/remove users
    add/remove student from a course
    search and print rosters and courses
    (Test) Test to see if the subclass functions oeprate and if it can use the base class functions 
6) Create UI to combine functionality of all users (Proposed timeline: 3 weeks)
7) Expand database (Proposed timeline: 1 week)


Matt Taylor Comments:
- I think that you should add "create basic inherited classes for student/instructer/admin" in step 1 if you want to create the database in step 2. 
  Otherwise how would you develop the database with one of each user?
- My only other critique is the timeline. I think that creating the student sublcass should be 2 weeks since it's not super intensive and that extra week
  can be tacked on to creating the admin subclass. 
The timeline looks good!
