The purpose of this project we will be creating a student databse comparable to leopardweb. This database 
should consist of students, teachers and admin. The students should be able to view their schedule and sign up for class.
Insstructors should be able to see the students in their class and schedule. The admin should have the ability to control 
the database.

    This powerpoint is a demo of how to setup an sqlite database for students and lecturers
    Can be used as a starting point to create the database, and we can add or remove attributes as necessary
    sqlite database can be integrated with the system using the python sqlite3 module

    This tutorial shows how to make a student management system in python
        add/remove students
        Print student list
        Search for student
        Update roll numbers
    This can be used to create a basic management system for a single class of user, and then expand for other subclasses of users
    
Matt Taylor Comments:
- My only suggestion is possibly adding in a bit more info on how the addition of these will help streamline the entire project.
  Other than that those are some solid resources!
