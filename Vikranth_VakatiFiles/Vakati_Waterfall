Waterfall Model:

Requirements
  University portal for students, instructors, and administrators. Each user has varying interfaces based on their privileges to interact with the system.
  System should work for 100 students, 10 instructors, and 1 admin
  Database of courses
  Multiple semesters
  Print out of schedule
  Scheduling preferences

System Design
  Inheritance with base class user, and subclasses:
    Student (Proposed timeline: 3 weeks)
      the student class will have functions that allow them to search courses, add/drop courses, print their schedule.
    Instructor (Proposed timeline: 3 weeks)
      the instructor class will have functions that allow them to print their schedule, print their class list, and search for courses.
    Admin (Proposed timeline: 3 weeks)
      add courses to the system
      remove courses from the system, add/remove users
      add/remove student from a course
      search and print rosters and courses
  Database of courses (Proposed timeline: 2 weeks)
    CRN
    Course name
    Times
    Instructor

Implementation and unit testing (Proposed timeline: 2 weeks)
  Test each subclass individually
    First test with a single user, then expand the database
    Test every function
    Test privileges/access of each subclass

Integration and system testing (Proposed timeline: 2 weeks)
  Combine functionality of all users into a UI
  
 
  Test each subclass individually (Repeat testing)
    First test with a single user, then expand the database
    Test every function
    Test privileges/access of each subclass
Comments: This looks good, but looks like it will take a long time, and if there is a delay in any of steps. It would take to long, and we wouldnt be able to finish the project in time.
