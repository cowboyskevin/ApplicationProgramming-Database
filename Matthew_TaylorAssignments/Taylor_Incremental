Outline Description: 
	We want a system that has the same requirements as found in the waterfall method. 
Phase 1:
1.	Build a basic function that will verify classes are working properly
2.	Build database that will contain all users
Phase 2:
1.	Build User class with functions that are used across all 3 user types
2.	Build Student class using inheritance, add extra functions (add/drop course)
3.	Add student to database for function testing
4.	Test the functionality of users, ensure that entering random strings doesnâ€™t break code, etc
Phase 3:
1.	Build Instructor class using inheritance, add extra functions
2.	Add instructor to database for testing purposes
3.	Test the functionality
Phase 4:
1.	Build admin class using inheritance, add extra functions
2.	Add admin to database for testing purposes
3.	Testing functionality
Phase 5:
1.	Build GUI to make it more presentable and easier to follow
2.	Test any sort of bugs for the GUI
3.	Re-test all of the databases/users to ensure that they still work properly with the new information

Vik's Comments:
might be easier to build and test with a database of 1 of each user first, then expand at the end
Kevin' Comments:
I agree with vik in his comments about the database. Other then that I like the build of each phase.
